Data Analysis
## Description
The goal of this project is to create an executive interactive dashboard that analyzes the data from 2016 to 2018 and gives insights into the data that help in decision-making which makes the company more profitable 
</br>
This is a data analysis project journey starting with data entry by inserting creating the tables and inserting the data in them using **SQL Server** then querying the wanted data from the database and calculate the revenue by multiply the **Total units** with **Price** then connecting the query to **Excel** and **Tableau** to make the dashboards 
</br>
The two dashboards share the same analysis process but **Tableau** give more space for the dashboard to be dynamic and more active active than **Execl**
</br>
*that because tableau is meant for visualization and dashboards*
</br>

</br>
the dashboard answers theses questions:
* What is the revenues in each year 
* What is the revenues in each month of the years
* What is the state that make the the highest revenues
* Which store sells the best
* Which category is more sold than others 
* Who are the top 10 salers to make revenue  to the company 
* Who are the 10 most valued customers according to the revenues
</br>
