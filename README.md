Data Analysis
## Description
The goal of this project is to create an executive interactive dashboard that analyzes the data from 2016 to 2018 and gives insights into the data that help in decision-making which makes the company more profitable 
</br>
This is a data analysis project journey starting with data entry by inserting creating the tables and inserting the data in them using SQL Server then querying the wanted data from the database then connecting the query to Excel and Tableau to make the dashboards 
</br>
The two dashboards share the same analysis process but **Tableau give more space for the dashboard to be dynamic and more active active than execl *that because tableau is meant for visualization and dashboards*
